# locomotion-commotion-pathfinding__
“Solution for the FIT2004 Assignment 1 problem Locomotion Commotion, implementing an optimal pathfinding algorithm that models roads and a cyclic train loop, builds a time-expanded graph, and uses Dijkstra’s algorithm with a custom MinHeap to compute the minimum-cost interception route
